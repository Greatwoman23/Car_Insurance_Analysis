# Car Insurance Analysis Project
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a car insurance dataset using multiple tools and technologies, including BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Tableau. The goal is to extract valuable insights from the data to support operational decision-making and upper management strategy.

# Project Overview
Data Storage and Querying with BigQuery
Operational Reporting with Looker Studio
Executive Dashboard with Tableau

# Project Structure

1. Data Storage and Querying with BigQuery
We utilized Google BigQuery to store and query the car insurance dataset. BigQuery provides a powerful and scalable platform for handling large datasets and performing complex SQL queries.

SQL Scripts: The bigquery/queries directory contains SQL scripts used for data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis.
Setup Instructions: Detailed instructions for setting up BigQuery and running the queries are provided in bigquery_setup.md.

2. Operational Reporting with Looker Studio
Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) was used to create an operational report that provides detailed insights into the dataset. The report covers policyholder demographics, vehicle information, claims data, income analysis, and geographic distribution.

# Report Highlights:

Age, gender, marital status, and education levels of policyholders.
Distribution of car makes, models, years, and colors.
Total and average claim amounts, claim frequency.
Correlation between household income and claim amounts.
Geographic distribution of claims.

3. Executive Dashboard with Tableau
A dashboard tailored for upper management was created using Tableau. This dashboard presents key metrics and trends in a visually appealing format, allowing for quick and informed decision-making.

# Key Metrics:

Total number of active insurance policies.
Aggregate sum of all claims.
Average claim amount per policy.
Claim frequency per policy.
Average household income of policyholders.

Demographic Insights:

Age, gender, marital status, and education levels of policyholders.

Vehicle Information:

Most common car makes, models, and years.
Claims Analysis:

Claims distribution by coverage zone and car use type.
Breakdown of claim amounts by car make and model.
Correlation between household income and claim amounts.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites
Google Cloud Platform: For using BigQuery.
Looker Studio: For creating and viewing operational reports.
